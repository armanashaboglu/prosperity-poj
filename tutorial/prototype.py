# ALGORITHMIC TRADING STRATEGY - IMC PROSPERITY COMPETITION
#=========================================================================
#
# CONTEXT & GOALS:
# ---------------
# This trading algorithm implements a sophisticated market-making strategy for the IMC Prosperity competition,
# handling multiple products with different trading characteristics:
# - RAINFOREST_RESIN: A stable-priced product (similar to Amethysts from the previous competition)
# - KELP: A more volatile product with changing price dynamics (similar to Starfruit)
#
# The primary goal is to maximize profit while managing risk and position limits through:
# 1. Efficient price discovery using product-specific fair value calculations
# 2. Smart order execution prioritizing favorable existing orders before placing new ones
# 3. Sophisticated position management to avoid getting stuck at position limits
# 4. Adaptable pricing based on current market conditions and position
#
# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
# --------------------
# The code uses an object-oriented design with an inheritance hierarchy:
# - Base Strategy class: Defines common operations for all strategies
# - MarketMakingStrategy: Implements sophisticated market-making logic with position management
# - Product-specific strategies: Implement custom fair value calculations for each product
#
# KEY COMPONENTS:
# -------------
# 1. STRATEGY HIERARCHY:
#    - Strategy (base class): Provides common methods like buy(), sell() and run()
#    - MarketMakingStrategy: Implements core market-making logic with position management
#    - RainforestResinStrategy: Uses stable true value (10000) for RAINFOREST_RESIN
#    - KelpStrategy: Uses dynamic true value calculation for KELP based on market data
#
# 2. POSITION MANAGEMENT:
#    - Window tracking: Maintains a sliding window (deque) of recent positions to detect if stuck at limits
#    - Liquidation modes: 
#      * Soft liquidation: Triggered when position is at limit for 50%+ of recent history
#      * Hard liquidation: Triggered when position is at limit for entire history
#    - Dynamic pricing: Adjusts max buy/sell prices based on current position 
#      (more conservative when position is already skewed)
#
# 3. ORDER EXECUTION PRIORITY:
#    - First phase: Take existing favorable orders in the market
#    - Second phase: If stuck at limits, place aggressive orders to rebalance position
#    - Third phase: Place regular market-making orders at competitive prices
#
# 4. PRICE CALCULATION:
#    - RAINFOREST_RESIN: Assumes stable true value of 10000
#    - KELP: Dynamic calculation based on most popular price points (highest volume)
#
# 5. STATE PERSISTENCE:
#    - save() and load() methods allow strategies to maintain state between rounds
#    - Critical for tracking position history and detecting stuck positions
#
# TRADING LOGIC DETAILS:
# --------------------
# 1. FAIR VALUE CALCULATION:
#    - Each product determines its own "true value" (fair price)
#    - True value serves as an anchor for buy/sell decisions
#
# 2. BUYING/SELLING LOGIC (3-phase approach):
#    - Phase 1: Take existing favorable orders in the market
#      * For buying: Take sell orders with price <= max_buy_price
#      * For selling: Take buy orders with price >= min_sell_price
#      * Quantity limited by both available volume and position capacity
#    
#    - Phase 2: Special handling for stuck positions
#      * If hard_liquidate: Trade aggressively at true value with 50% of remaining capacity
#      * If soft_liquidate: Trade somewhat aggressively (true_valueÂ±2) with 50% of remaining capacity
#    
#    - Phase 3: Place new orders at competitive prices
#      * Find popular price points based on volume
#      * Place remaining capacity at competitive price relative to existing orders
#
# 3. POSITION MANAGEMENT:
#    - Dynamic max_buy_price and min_sell_price based on position
#      * When long (positive position), lower max_buy_price to reduce buying
#      * When short (negative position), raise min_sell_price to reduce selling
#    - Sliding window tracks if positions are consistently at limits
#    - Liquidation modes trigger more aggressive pricing to escape stuck positions
#
# This strategy improves upon basic market-making by:
# - Taking any favorable prices, not just specific fixed ones
# - Actively managing positions to prevent getting stuck
# - Dynamically adjusting pricing based on market conditions
# - Prioritizing immediate execution when favorable

"""
###TO DO LATER##
# - Analyze the log file and the csv file carefully to see if we can detect any anomalies
# - Try to record the trades we did only with hidden bots between iterations (timestamps)
# - Right now, trading works this way: At the start of each iteration, we observe the order book data for each product (after some bots have traded). 
# - Then, we send our orders to the exchange(matching engine) and record the orders.
#   After that, orders that get matched are filled, the rest or the ones that were partially filled are left in the order book.
#   At the end of the iteration, other bots trade with the remaining orders in the order book and our orders that do not get filled drop out of the order book, 
#   partially filled orders are left in the order book.
#   So the order looks like this each timestamp(iteration):  Bots -> Trader -> some other bots
#   there is x bots with priority over us and y bots with no priority over us, these numbers are constant across all iterations and products.
#   The problem with this is that we don't know which trades were done by the hidden bots.
#   We need to find a way to detect the hidden bots and predict their trades.
# - We can try to detect the hidden bots by analyzing the trades that happen between iterations.
#   If a trade happens between iterations, it is likely to be done by a hidden bot.
#   We can then predict the trades of the hidden bots and trade against them.
#----------------------------
# Turns out we receive market_trades dictionary
# This variable contains all trades AFTER you on previous iteration and BEFORE you in current one
# there can be no trades on specific product. Data could come from previous iterations ( for example if a market trade received at timestamp 0 for product A, 
# it could be that this trade is still in market_trades for product A after n iterations if no other trades were made on product A)
# So we need to find a way utilize this data to our advantage.
# certain factors affect these hidden bots trades, but trades done on previous iterations do not affect current iteration trades (admin said this)
# Current iter order book data probably affect bot trades, so we need to find a way to predict the trades of the hidden bots.
# Todo 2: visualizing the exectued trades of hidden bots might help us figuring out the true fair price of each asset per iteration (since bots know the fair price)
# Also, a visualizing the histogram of bid ask orders might be useful
