# IMC Prosperity 3 - Algorithmic Trading Strategies - [Team POJ]

## Overview

This repository contains the algorithmic trading strategies, analysis tools, and documentation developed by my solo/duo team poj for the [IMC Prosperity 3](https://imc-prosperity.notion.site/Prosperity-3-Documentation-19ee8453a0938100a71f3ae712d350b0) competition.
