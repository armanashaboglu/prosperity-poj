@https://github.com/ShubhamAnandJain/IMC-Prosperity-2023-Stanford-Cardinal (Prosperity 1, 2nd place)

Someone also created a backtester tool so we can locally test our algorithms before uploading it to the website. 
@https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-backtester/tree/master 

Every time we upload our algorithm to the website or locally backtest, we get a .log file that contains sandbox logs , activities log which show the LOB for each product at every timestamp, and trade history which contains every trade happened in each timestamp.

There is also a visualizer tool made by someone which is open source. It works by just uploading the log file to the visualiser website and it generates various graphs.
